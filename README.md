# Lambdas

The purpose of this project is to practice and understand the use of Lambdas.

Design

The objective of this homework is to demonstrate the use of Lambda expressions and blocks. The purpose of the assignment is to use 3 Lambda expressions to determine and return the minimum, maximum, and average values of a list of doubles. I plan on creating an array in Java and using pre-existing utility functions to achieve this. The second task is to sort the list using the Collections sort utility and to return the median. I will do a simple if-else block to calculate the median for either an even list of numbers or an odd list of numbers. Once each lambda expression/block is created I will display the results.
